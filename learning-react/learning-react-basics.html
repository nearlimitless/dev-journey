        <!--    This block of code finds the element that we've assign the "app" ID to, which in this case, the div.
                    const app = document.getElementById('app'); 

                The 'props' inside the parameter() of the function Header stores the variables/value from the parent component, 
                which in this case the HomePage component passes the value of the variable title to the props parameter to change
                the value depending on what the parent component passes to the child component. This is also called "Object Destructuring"

                In short, function HomePage pass the title = "React" to fuction Header and stores it inside (props) ready to be used.
                Then, depending on what is passed, you can get specific variables that you want to use, in this case, props.title

                This block of code creates a root inside the div with the "app" ID.
                    const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(app);

                This block of code renders the react element into the root
                    root.render(<HomePage />);
